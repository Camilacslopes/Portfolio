**Portfolio Site**

This is a simple portfolio site developed using only JavaScript, CSS and HTML. The goal of the site is to provide a platform to display and highlight personal projects and relevant skills.

Technologies Used
- HTML: HTML is used to create the basic structure of the site, defining the elements and organization of the page.

- CSS: CSS is used to stylize the site and define the visual appearance, including colors, fonts, layout, and animations.

- JavaScript: JavaScript is responsible for the interactivity of the site, allowing you to add interactive effects such as animations, smooth scrolling, contact forms, and image galleries.

**Structure of the Site**
- The portfolio website consists of the following main parts:

- Header: The header contains your name or logo, as well as a navigation bar with links to different sections of the site, such as "Home", "Projects", "Skills" and "Contact".

- Featured Section: The featured section is the first section visible to visitors and includes a personal introduction and photo.

- Projects Section: In this section, you can display a selection of projects or work done. Each project can be represented by a thumbnail image, and by clicking on an image, visitors can get more information about the project on a separate page.

- Skills Section: In this section, you can highlight your main skills, using graphics, icons or lists.

- Contact Section: The contact section contains a contact form or contact information, such as email address, social media links, and a button to download your resume.
